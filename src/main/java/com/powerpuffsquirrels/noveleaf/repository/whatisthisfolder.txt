So the repository is where our Spring Data JPA repository is located. The repository is an interface that extends the
JpaRepository interface. The JpaRepository interface is a part of the Spring Data JPA library. It provides methods for
performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Remove) operations on the entity. The JpaRepository interface takes two
parameters: the entity type and the type of the entityâ€™s primary key.

So basically this is where we will define our custom queries.
