# Motivation
Many readers feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of books available and struggle to discover titles that genuinely capture their interest. While numerous platforms offer reading recommendations, they often fail to deliver personalized suggestions that reflect the unique tastes and reading histories of individual users. This leads to missed opportunities for discovering new books. Our goal is to bridge this gap by offering a sophisticated, user-centric recommendation engine.


# Proposed Approach
Our app will address these issues by providing a tailored book discovery experience through algorithms that offer highly personalized book recommendations. We plan on integrating a user’s reading history, ratings, preferences, and peer reviews into our recommendation engine. This comprehensive understanding of a user’s reading tastes will enable our program to suggest books that are truly tailored to each reader. However, a limitation of our approach is the initial scarcity of user data, which is critical for generating accurate and personalized recommendations. As new users join with limited interaction history, the recommendation engine may initially struggle to deliver highly personalized suggestions.
Our solution revolves around building a web application. The front-end of our website will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating an intuitive and responsive interface where users can search for books, manage their reading lists, rate books, and receive personalized recommendations. The back-end will be handled by a Java server responsible for processing user data and requests and generating book recommendations. For retrieving book metadata, the Java server will rely on external APIs, most likely the Google Books API. The Java server will also communicate with a SQL database that stores all user profile data and any useful book metadata. Finally, the entire web application itself will need to be hosted on a cloud-based web server. This is the only “hardware” that the project will require.
